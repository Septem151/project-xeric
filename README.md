**Zeah Clan Rank & Task Tracking Plugin**

Project Xeric is a plugin designed for the "**Zeah Ironmen**" clan. The plugin features task tracking, a ranking system, leaderboards, and account exception tracking.

The plugin adds a sidebar panel that features two tabs:

1. A Player Profile section which includes a task list of each different tier of task and a player status card, and
2. A Leaderboard section that has a link to the WiseOldMan group for the clan.

## Changelog
